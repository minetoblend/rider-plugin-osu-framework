A rider plugin for [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/).

Mainly just an experiment for now cuz I want to learn the rider plugin sdk.

Todo-list:
- [x] Navigate to `[Cached]` and `dependencies.CacheAs()` calls for the type of a `[Resolved]` property.
- [ ] Navigate to `[Resolved]` properties for the type of a `[Cached]` property/class or `dependencies.CacheAs()`.
- [x] Display inlay hints for the above
- [ ] Add common bindable-related refactorings
- [ ] Auto-complete for resource paths
